<em>Commentator</em>: Younggil An, GoGameGuru

This was the second game in a ten game match between Fujisawa Hosai 9p and Go Seigen 9p. It was played on February 25 and 26, 1943.

Go Seigen is regarded as the greatest Go player in the history of Go. We refer to him as a 'living legend' in Korea. 

He was born on June 12, 1914, so next year (in 2014), he'll celebrate his 100th birthday. By the way, according to the way age is counted in some Asian cultures, Go Seigen will turn 100 this year (in 2013).

His style of play was so different from other top pros at the time, and he won nearly all of his ten game matches (jubango).

The only ten game match Go Seigen lost was this series against Fujisawa Hosai (4-6 in Fujisawa's favor). However, Fujisawa was taking black in all games and there was no komi. They played with a handicap called 'josen' (black in all games) because Go Seigen was 8 dan and Fujisawa was 6 dan at the time.

Fujisawa Hosai was very famous for his mirror Go. He kept experimenting with mirror Go because he wanted to learn all about it.

He didn't just mimic though, he spent more time than his opponents did, and he often got into byo-yomi situations (was short of time) in the middle game. He played with the sort of full concentration that Cho Chikun 9p does.

There were two famous players named Fujisawa in the Japanese Go world. Fujisawa Shuko (Hideyuki) 9p was the uncle of Fujisawa Hosai, even though he was 6 years younger.

Fujisawa Hosai was also the first professional player to be promoted to 9 dan under the Japanese Oteai system (Go Seigen was the second). They played two more ten game matches on even terms when they were both 9 dan (the only two 9 dans at the time) and Go Seigen won both of them.

;W[cn]LB[fc:A][gc:C][fd:B][gd:D][dh:E]C[This large knight's enclosure was Go Seigen's favorite. You can see this enclosure a lot in his games. Since there's no komi, white should play more actively, to lead things towards a complicated game.

Black should double approach in the top left next and there are several options (A-D). If black plays elsewhere, white can play a pincer extension at E, creating a good relationship with his enclosure in the lower left.]

The result was favorable for white, because white can still exploit aji at A-C later, or play at D-F, so black has bad aji at the top.

White caught up a bit here, but black's still slightly ahead on the board and white doesn't have komi.]

It was an interesting game.

The first fight, starting with A, was very interesting, and the result of the trade was good for white.

The second fight, ending at B, was also good for white, and the game became even (without komi).

Black C was a questionable move, and white took the lead in the game.

Black D was a bit too early, and Go Seigen showed one of his specialties - fighting ko. He was able to use the ko to finish the game decisively.

Throughout the whole game, I couldn't find any mistakes or bad moves for white, and that's very impressive.

Top players today still make lots of mistakes. Even though the short time limits of today's games can partially explain this, it doesn't diminish Go Seigen's greatness and uniqueness.

Fujisawa Hosai was also one of the best players of his generation, but because Go Seigen was too special, Fujisawa's moves don't seem to be that special in comparison. His greatness was overshadowed by Go Seigen.

However, we should remember that he was the only player who ever managed to defeat Go Seigen in ten game match.

I hope you've to enjoyed seeing this classic game and can feel some of the differences between this game and modern games. :)
